#🌾 Crop Yield and Weather Data Analyser
#📌 Abstract

This project analyzes the relationship between crop yield and weather conditions such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity using Python, NumPy, and Pandas. By combining crop production data with regional weather data, the system helps identify how climatic factors influence agricultural productivity. The goal is to provide clear, data-driven insights that support better agricultural planning and decision-making.

🔍 Problem Statement

Crop yield is highly dependent on weather conditions, but this relationship is often unclear due to unorganized and scattered data. Farmers and policymakers lack simple analytical tools to understand how climate impacts agricultural output.

#🎯 Objectives

Analyze crop yield trends across regions and years

Study the impact of weather parameters on crop productivity

Perform statistical and correlation analysis

Visualize results for easy interpretation
